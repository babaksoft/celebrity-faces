## Business problem

(TODO: Write a short paragraph about the main business problem this model is trying to solve)

## Dataset summary

(TODO: Provide a quick introduction of dataset features and target in tabular markdown format)

## Performance metric(s)

(TODO: Write a short paragraph that states optimized metric(s) in this model, as well as the rationale for choosing this metric)

## Final model

(TODO: Write a short paragraph about the final model, display overall metrics in tabular markdown format)

### Confusion matrix

(TODO: Link to a saved CM plot from *metrics* folder)

## Try it out!

(TODO: Provide clear instructions for how to make a prediction with this model)

### Use cloud-deployed model

(TODO: Provide sample code for making a prediction using the Web API deployed in AWS)

### Use local model

(TODO: Provide sample code for starting a local Web API inside Docker and making a prediction)

## Train the model

(TODO: Provide clear instructions for training your final model inside a Docker container - demonstrates *reproducible training*)
